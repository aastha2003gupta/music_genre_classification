# music_genre_classification
**Overview**
This project aims to classify music genres using a neural network model. It utilizes MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) features extracted from audio files to train the model for genre prediction

In this music genre classification project, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers is employed to model sequential patterns within the audio data. LSTMs are particularly well-suited for processing sequential data, making them a suitable choice for tasks like music genre classification, where the temporal relationships in the audio signal are crucial.

The model is trained for 50 epochs, implying that it undergoes 50 complete iterations through the entire dataset during the training phase. The choice of 50 epochs may depend on the size of the dataset and the convergence behavior of the model. Training for a sufficient number of epochs helps the model learn the underlying patterns in the data, while avoiding overfitting, where the model memorizes the training data and fails to generalize well to unseen examples.

It's worth noting that the optimal number of epochs can vary based on factors such as dataset size, complexity of the task, and model architecture. It's a common practice to monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop training when the performance starts to plateau or degrade, preventing overfitting.

Experimenting with different hyperparameters, such as the number of LSTM units, dropout rates, and learning rates, could provide insights into improving the model's performance. Additionally, visualizing training and validation metrics over epochs, such as accuracy and loss, can offer valuable insights into the model's learning process and generalization capabilities.
